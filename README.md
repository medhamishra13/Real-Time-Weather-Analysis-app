In simple words, Real-time weather analysis app is one such mobile application that informs the users about the climate conditions, atmospheric predictions, and any updates on the weather. It is a medium to know any upcoming weather patterns in the environment. If someone is planning a trip to any destination, they can know the weather of that destination in advance. Accordingly, one can plan a visit to that particular destination and postpone/prepone it if the weather is unsuitable on a specific day or time. The app is specifically designed to be more user-friendly for those sections of the society who are not enough literate but whose occupation is dependent on reliable weather forecasts to a great extent. Example- farmers and fishermen • Users can know the weather conditions of the current place using GPS and can also search for any location worldwide to know its weather conditions. The app will also provide weather prediction reports for a place for up to 5 days. The background colour will be changed according to the temperature. If the temperature is too high, the background colour will become red or orange; if the temperature is too low, the background colour will become blue or silver.
